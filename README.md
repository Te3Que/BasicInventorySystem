# BasicInventorySystem
 A basic inventory system made in dotnet
 it uses an api that have connection to a db, here it's MongoDB.
 And uses Blazor as a UX.

 To run the project start a MongoDB (or any other db) however you want, and do required changes to make the code work with the db. There should not be much to change if you use a mongodb in a docker container or something like that.

Next if you want to easily run them in developer mode, change the run.ps1 to fit the directory you have choosen.

And ofc you need dotnet SDK to run this project
